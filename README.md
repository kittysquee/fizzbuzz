# Fizzbuzz Pairing challenge

This is precourse work for [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/). This is a pairing task to be carried out by myself and another member of my cohort, to practice pair programming and test driven development. This task introduced us to [RSpec](http://rspec.info/), which is a test suite for Ruby.
